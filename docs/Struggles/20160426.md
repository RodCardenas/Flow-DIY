###Picture Management in the Project
When starting the project I was sure I didn't want to store pictures locally, but I was unsure on how to manage them to prevent slow downs in the project and allow for the easiest integration with the rest of the application. After some hours of research, I have decided to use cloudinary due to its ease of use, blazing speed, and its robust platform. The cherry on top of the cake is the possibility of making use of carrierwave with cloudinary to further facilitate the avatar creation in the user model.
